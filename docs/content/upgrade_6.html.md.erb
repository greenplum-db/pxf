title: Upgrading from an Earlier PXF 6 Release
---

If you have installed a PXF 6.x `rpm` or `deb` package and have configured and are using PXF in your current Greenplum Database 5.21.2+ or 6.x installation, you must perform some upgrade actions when you install a new version of PXF 6.x.

The PXF upgrade procedure has three steps. You perform one pre-install procedure, the install itself, and then a post-install procedure to upgrade to PXF 6.x

-   [Step 1: Perform the PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions](#pxfpre)
-   [Step 2: Install the New PXF 6.x](#pxfinst)
-   [Step 3: Complete the Upgrade to a Newer PXF 6.x](#pxfup)


## <a id="pxfpre"></a>Step 1: Perform the PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions

Perform this procedure before you upgrade to a new version of PXF 6.x:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

1. Identify and note the version of PXF currently running in your Greenplum cluster:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf version
    ```

1. Stop PXF on each Greenplum host as described in [Stopping PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#stop_pxf):

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster stop
    ```

1. Back up the PXF user configuration files; for example, if `PXF_BASE=/usr/local/pxf-gp6`:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ cp -avi /usr/local/pxf-gp6 pxf_base.bak
    ```


## <a id="pxfinst"></a>Step 2: Installing the New PXF 6.x

Follow the steps outlined in [Installing PXF 6.x](../release/installing_pxf.html), and identify and note the new PXF version number.


## <a id="pxfup"></a>Step 3: Completing the Upgrade to a Newer PXF 6.x

After you install the new version of PXF, perform the following procedure:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

1. PXF 6.x includes a new version of the `pxf` extension. Register the extension files with Greenplum Database (see [pxf cluster register](ref/pxf-cluster.html)). `$GPHOME` must be set when you run this command:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster register
    ```

1. You must update the `pxf` extension in every Greenplum database in which you are using PXF. A database superuser or the database owner must run this SQL command in the `psql` subsystem or in an SQL script:

    ``` sql
    ALTER EXTENSION pxf UPDATE;
    ```

1. **If you are upgrading <i>from</i> PXF version 6.0.x**:
    - upgrade step for config property
    - (tbd?) upgrade step for external tables accessing avro arrays
    - (tbd?) upgrade step for external tables accessing json objects

1. Synchronize the PXF configuration from the master host to the standby master and each Greenplum Database segment host. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster sync
    ```
 
1. Start PXF on each Greenplum host as described in [Starting PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#start_pxf):

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ pxf cluster start
    ```
