``` pre
pxf cluster <command> [<option>]
```

where `<command>` is:

``` pre
help
init (deprecated)

restart
start

sync
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

The `pxf cluster` utility command manages PXF on the master, standby master, and on all Greenplum Database segment hosts. You can use the utility to:

- Start, stop, and restart the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.
- Display the status of the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.
- Synchronize the PXF configuration from the Greenplum Database master host to the standby master and to all segment hosts.
- Copy the PXF extension control file from the PXF installation on each host to the Greenplum installation on the host after a Greenplum upgrade.
- Prepare a new `$PXF_BASE` runtime configuration directory.

`pxf cluster` requires a running Greenplum Database cluster. You must run the utility on the Greenplum Database master host.

(If you want to manage the PXF Service instance on a specific segment host, use the `pxf` utility. See [`pxf`](pxf.html#topic1).)

## <a id="commands"></a>Commands

<dt>help</dt>
<dd>Display the `pxf cluster` help message and then exit.</dd>

<dt>init (deprecated)</dt>
<dd>The command is equivalent to the `register` command.</dd>

<dt>prepare</dt>
<dd>Prepare a new `$PXF_BASE` directory on each Greenplum Database host. When you run the command, you must identify the new PXF runtime configuration directory via an environment variable named `PXF_BASE`. PXF copies runtime configuration file templates and directories to this `$PXF_BASE`.</dd>

<dt>register</dt>
<dd>Copy the PXF extension control file from the PXF installation on each host to the Greenplum installation on the host. This command requires that `$GPHOME` be set, and is run once after you install PXF 6.x the first time, or run after you upgrade your Greenplum Database installation.</dd>

<dt>reset (deprecated) </dt>
<dd>The command is a no-op.</dd>

<dt>restart</dt>
<dd>Stop, and then start, the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.</dd>

<dt>start</dt>
<dd>Start the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.</dd>

<dt>status  </dt>
<dd>Display the status of the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.</dd>

<dt>stop  </dt>
<dd>Stop the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts.</dd>

<dt>sync  </dt>
<dd>Synchronize the PXF configuration (`$PXF_BASE`) from the master to the standby master and to all Greenplum Database segment hosts. By default, this command updates files on and copies files to the remote. You can instruct PXF to also delete files during the synchronization; see [Options](#options).</dd>
<dd>If you have updated the PXF user configuration or add new JAR or native library dependencies, you must also restart PXF after you synchronize the PXF configuration.</dd>

## <a id="options"></a>Options

The `pxf cluster sync` command takes the following option:

<dt>&#8211;d | &#8211;&#8211;delete </dt>
<dd>Delete any files in the PXF user configuration on the standby master and segment hosts that are not also present on the master host.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

Stop the PXF Service instance on the master, standby master, and all segment hosts:

``` shell
$ pxf cluster stop
```

Synchronize the PXF configuration to the standby and all segment hosts, deleting files that do not exist on the master host:

``` shell
$ pxf cluster sync --delete
```
