title: Upgrading PXF During a Greenplum 5 to 6 Upgrade Using gpupgrade
---

PXF 6.3.0 introduces support for Greenplum Database `gpupgrade`. If you are running PXF with Greenplum Database 5.x and plan to use `gpupgrade` for an in-place upgrade to Greenplum Database 6.x, you must perform some additional steps prior to, and after, running `gpupgrade`.


## <a id="pre"></a>Pre-gpupgrade Actions

Before you run `gpupgrade`, perform the following steps:

1. Upgrade your Greenplum Database 5 PXF installation to the latest release (6.3.0 or newer); refer to the [Upgrading PXF](upgrade_landing.html) documentation for instructions on upgrading PXF.

1. Note the PXF version.

1. Install the Greenplum Database 6-specific PXF package of the same version on every segment host in the cluster. You need only install the PXF package; you do not need to run the `pxf cluster prepare` or `pxf cluster register` commands.

1. Log in to the master host of your Greenplum Database 5 cluster:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ 
    ```

1. Run the following commands to set up your environment; substitute the file system path to your Greenplum 5 install directory:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ export GPHOME=<greenplum5-install-dir>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp5/bin/pxf-before-gpupgrade
    ```

    **Note:** The `pxf-before-gpupgrade` script must connect to your running Greenplum Database 5 cluster. By default, it attempts to connect to the `gpadmin` database on `localhost` on port `5432` as the `gpadmin` user (no password). If you need to customize these setting, refer to [Customizing the Greenplum Connection Parameters](#env) for instructions on setting environment variables for this purpose.

1. Stop the PXF cluster; note that PXF external tables will be inaccessible during the Greenplum Database upgrade process.

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp5/bin/pxf cluster stop
    ```

1. Your PXF cluster is ready for upgrading by `gpupgrade`; return to the `gpupgrade` documentation to upgrade from Greenplum Database 5 to Greenplum Database 6.


## <a id="post"></a>Post-gpupgrade Actions

Perform the following steps after running `gpupgrade`:

1. Determine if the `gpupgrade` process succeeded or failed.

1. **If the `gpupgrade` process failed**:

    1. Run the following commands to roll back your PXF cluster to its previous state (before you ran `pxf-before-gpupgrade`):

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ export GPHOME=<greenplum5-install-dir>
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp5/bin/pxf-after-gpupgrade
        ```

        **Note:** The `pxf-after-upgrade` script must to connect to your running Greenplum Database 5 cluster. By default, it attempts to connect to the `gpadmin` database on `localhost` on port `5432` as the `gpadmin` user, no password. If you need to customize these settings, refer to [Customizing the Greenplum Connection Parameters](#env) for instructions on setting environment variables for this purpose.

    1. Restart the Greenplum Database 5 PXF cluster.

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp5/bin/pxf cluster start
        ```

    1. You may choose to uninstall the PXF for Greenplum 6 package.

    1. **Exit this procedure.**

1. **If the `gpupgrade` process succeeded, perform the remaining steps in this procedure.**

1. Configure your PXF cluster as though it was a fresh install in Greenplum Database 6:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ export GPHOME=<greenplum6-install-dir>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp6/bin/pxf-after-gpupgrade
    ```

    **Note:** The `pxf-after-upgrade` script must to connect to your running Greenplum Database 6 cluster. By default, it attempts to connect to the `gpadmin` database on `localhost` on port `5432` as the `gpadmin` user, no password. If you need to customize these settings, refer to [Customizing the Greenplum Connection Parameters](#env) for instructions on setting environment variables for this purpose.

1. If you nave not relocated your `$PXF_BASE`, you must copy the PXF configuration from the PXF Greenplum Database 5 install location to the PXF Greenplum Database 6 install location. For example:

    ``` bash
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ for dir in conf lib servers keytabs; do
        cp -aiv /usr/local/pxf-gp5/$dir/. /usr/local/pxf-gp6/$dir/
    done
    ```

1. Synchronize the PXF configuration from the Greenplum Database master host to the standby and segment hosts:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp6/bin/pxf cluster sync
    ```

1. Start the Greenplum Database 6 PXF cluster.

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ /usr/local/pxf-gp6/bin/pxf cluster start
    ```

1. Update the `$PATH` in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` shell initialization scripts, replacing any occurrences of `/usr/local/pxf-gp5` with `/usr/local/pxf-gp6`.

1. Verify that PXF can access each external data source by querying external tables that specify each configured PXF server.

1. (_Optional_) Uninstall the PXF for Greenplum Database 5 package on every segment host in the GPDB cluster; this operation requires `sudo` privileges. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ yum remove pxf-gp5
    ```

## <a id="env"></a>Customizing the Greenplum Connection Parameters

The PXF scripts that you run before and after `gpupgrade` must connect to your running Greenplum Database 5 or 6 cluster. By default, the scripts attempt to connect to the `gpadmin` database on `localhost` on port `5432` as the `gpadmin` user, no password. If you need to customize these settings, you can do so by specifying the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description                                           |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `$PGHOST`            | localhost     | The host name or IP address of the Greenplum Database master host. |
| `$PGPORT`            | 5432          | The port number to connect to on the master host.     |
| `$PGDATABASE`        | gpadmin       | The name of the database. |
| `$PGUSER`            | gpadmin       | The Greenplum Database user name.     |
| `$PGPASSWORD`        | _none_        | The password for the user. |
