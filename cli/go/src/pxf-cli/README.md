# `pxf cluster` CLI

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you are set up for PXF development by following the README.md at the root of this repository. This tool requires Go version 1.9 or higher. Follow the directions [here](https://golang.org/doc/) to get the language set up.

1. Go to the pxf-cluster folder and install dependencies
   ```
   cd pxf/server/pxf-cli/go/src/pxf-cli
   go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
   ```

1. Run the tests
   ```
   make test
   ```

1. Build the CLI
   ```
   make
   ```
   This will put the binary at `pxf/server/pxf-cli/go/bin/pxf-cli`. You can also install the binary into `${PXF_HOME}/bin/pxf-cli` with:
   ```
   make install
   ```

## Debugging the CLI on a live system

Because it's hard to mock out a Greenplum cluster, it's useful to debug on a real live cluster. We can do this using the [`delve`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) project.

1. Install `dlv` command, see [here](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/installation/linux/install.md) for more details:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
```

2. Optionally create a file with a list of commands, this could be useful to save you from re-running commands. You can actually run them with the `source` command in the `dlv` REPL:

```
config max-string-len 1000
break vendor/github.com/greenplum-db/gp-common-go-libs/cluster/cluster.go:351
continue
print commandList
```

3. Run the `dlv` command to enter the interactive REPL:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/pxf/cli/go/src/pxf-cli
GPHOME=/usr/local/greenplum-db dlv debug pxf-cli -- cluster restart
```

The [help page for dlv](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli) is useful.
