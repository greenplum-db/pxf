-- @description query01 for pushing down predicates of type char that were
-- padded during write. Hive right trims values for type char, for example
-- when a value 'a  ' is inserted into a Hive table stored as parquet, Hive will
-- only store 'a' in the parquet file.

-- Display on for output consistency between GPDB 5 and 6
