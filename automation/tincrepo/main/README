-> tincrepo is the perforce repository that will host all the test scripts that can be run atop tinc. For eg: , all the SQL files, python test methods etc.
-> 'tinc.py' should be able to run any tests off tincrepo and should always be in sync with //tinc/main
-> Every folder containing tests in tincrepo will be mapped to a collection in tincdb which makes it easier to have a synchronous mapping between the tests in tincrepo and the test definitions in tincdb. For eg: tests in tincrepo/benchmarks/tpch will be a part of the collection 'tincrepo.benchmarks.tpch' and so on and so forth.
-> To make it easier for any user to find relevant tests for a bug fix or a changelist , tincrepo will impose a specific folder structure while checking-in tests to the repository.

NOTE: Perforce does not allow a configuration where we can prevent users from creating new categories of tests. So it is the test author's responsibility to not grow tincrepo/main vertically. Please use caution while adding tests for new features. 

Following is the initial test classification that was decided upon for tincrepo:

benchmarks
catalog
cursors
data_mining
ddl
dispatch
dml
errors
functions
interconnect
languages
loading
mirroring
olap
partitioning
query
resource_management
security
storage
transactions
types
user_defined_objects
utilities
vacuum

While checking-in tests for a feature, the tests should belong to one of the above mentioned categories making it easier for users to find tests to run for a specific feature or a changelist. For eg: , tpch tests should go into benchmarks/tpch, upgrade tests should belong to utilities/upgrade etc.
