This Document describe the multi_block_tables.json format

The purpose of this file is to contain a list of meta information for table and data 
that can be tested by automation multi block feature tests.
The data meta information is defined under the name "dataPattern" 

The list can be modified and extended with new entries 

Each entry has the following format 

  {
      "tableName":  Name of created external table and hdfs file
      "dataPattern": {
	      "coulmnsTypeList":  A comma separated list of types, that define the external table columns order and types
	        The value can be 
				         "BOOLEAN", 
				         "SMALLINT",

	                      repeated  to the size of "dataSizeInMegaBytes"
	      "dataSizeInMegaBytes":  Size in megabytes of data to be generated and loaded to HDFS
	      "randomValues" : in case of dynamic generated values, define if to generate random values of fixed/incremental values
	      "columnMaxSize" : max size of each column (relevant for no fixed types like TEXT, NUMERIC)
