TINC (a.k.a. "TINC Is Not Cdbfast") ============================================
================================================================================

	TINC is a new attempt at Greenplum's core testing infrastructure. From it's
name, it should be clear that TINC is designed with the pitfalls of its 
predecessor in mind. The most important of these requirements is a philosophy
of rigid design at the core of the project. CDBFast lacked this quality, and
it's one that we'll strongly adhere to under TINC.

Rules ----------------------------------
----------------------------------------

	Rule #1: Read PEP8! <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

	Rule #2: See Rule #1.

The above usually covers most concerns. Here are a few extra ones we feel
strongly about:

* You must run `make check` prior to checkin.
* You must run `make regresscheck` prior to checkin.
* You cannot check-in any changes that break `make check` or `make regresscheck`.
* You must run `make checkcode` and fix your error before checkin.
* If revising TestLink integration code, you must run `make testlinkcheck` prior to checkin.
* You should not use numbering in testcase name.
